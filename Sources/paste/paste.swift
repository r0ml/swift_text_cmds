  /*
   I’m given a C code to convert to Swift, and there’s a key instruction to not change any variable or function names. It’s clear that the task is about preserving the original code while translating it, so I’ll focus on the syntax and structural differences between C and Swift. I need to be careful with things that might differ, like memory management or type declarations, but I’m definitely supposed to keep the variable and function names untouched.
   None
   
   In the C code, we see the global variables tab and delim, and we need to preserve those in Swift. I’ll declare tab as a fileprivate var, possibly like fileprivate var tab: [wchar_t] = [9, 0]. For delim, which is a pointer, I’ll declare it as var delim: UnsafeMutablePointer<wchar_t>? = nil. Likewise, delimcnt becomes an Int. In Swift, we’ll still need a main function to match the C main, but with Swift syntax. I’ll also map C functions like getopt and setlocale to their Swift equivalents where needed.
   
   In the C code, I see variable declarations like ch, rval, seq, and types like wchar_t *warg. I’ll translate these to Swift types such as Int32 for the integers and UnsafeMutablePointer<wchar_t>? for pointers, keeping variable names intact.
   For memory allocations, in Swift, I’ll use UnsafeMutableRawPointer for malloc, or better, define classes like LIST to handle instances. The parallel function uses LIST *lp for file handling, and I’ll convert this into an appropriate Swift class-based solution with a while loop to process argv.
   */
  
  
  /*
   Explanation
   1.  Global Variables and Types:
   The global variable tab is defined as a pointer to a wide‐character array (L”\t”). Two additional globals, delim and delimcnt, are declared exactly as in C.
   2.  main Function:
   The Swift main function uses the same variable names as in C. It calls setlocale(LC_CTYPE, "") and then processes command–line options via getopt("d:s"). When the -d option is encountered it converts the multibyte string in optarg to wide characters using mbsrtowcs (first to determine length, then to perform the conversion). The result is stored in warg and then assigned to delim (and its count computed via a call to tr).
   3.  File Processing:
   After option processing the code checks for at least one filename. Then, depending on whether the -s flag was set, it calls either sequential or parallel (both accepting the remaining argv array). Finally, on Apple platforms it checks for output errors and then exits with the appropriate return value.
   4.  LIST, parallel, and sequential:
   The C structure _list is translated to the class LIST with identical member names. The functions parallel and sequential traverse the list of file names and process them as in the original C code, printing wide–characters with putwchar and using getwc for input.
   5.  tr and usage:
   The function tr processes a wide–character string by translating escape sequences (e.g. \n, \t, \0) exactly as in C. The usage function prints the usage message and exits.
